# Website Crawler

This repository contains a simple and efficient website crawler implemented in Python. The crawler is designed to traverse websites, collect data, and store the results for further analysis. This project is suitable for educational purposes and can be used as a foundation for more advanced web scraping and crawling tasks.

## Features

- **URL Traversal**: Traverses through the website starting from a given URL.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts specific data such as links, images, and text from web pages.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to extract additional data or handle more complex crawling requirements.
- **Storage**: Stores the extracted data in a structured format for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arifbinekram/website-crawler.git
   cd website-crawler
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure the crawler**:
   Modify the `config.py` file to set the starting URL and other configuration options according to your needs.

2. **Run the crawler**:
   ```sh
   python crawler.py
   ```

3. **View the results**:
   The results will be stored in the specified output format (e.g., JSON, CSV) as configured in the `config.py` file.

## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains various configuration options that can be adjusted to customize the crawler's behavior. Key settings include:

- **START_URL**: The initial URL from which the crawler will start.
- **MAX_DEPTH**: The maximum depth the crawler will traverse.
- **OUTPUT_FORMAT**: The format in which the extracted data will be saved (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- **USER_AGENT**: The User-Agent string to be used by the crawler.

## Example

Here is an example of how to configure and run the crawler:

1. **Set the starting URL** in `config.py`:
   ```python
   START_URL = "https://example.com"
   ```

2. **Run the crawler**:
   ```sh
   python crawler.py
   ```

3. **Check the output**:
   The extracted data will be saved in the output file specified in `config.py`.
